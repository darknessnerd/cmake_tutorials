# Introduction

This example shows how to download and build the google test library, create tests and run them.

The files in this tutorial are below:

```
```


# Requirements

An internet connection. This example will download the google test library the first time you run the CMake configure step.
 See the [google test readme](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/README.md).
 
 
 # Concepts
 
 ## Download and Build Google Test
 
 This will add the CMake files which download and build Google Test. 
 
```
add_subdirectory(3rd_party/google-test)
```

Alternatives to this method include:

* Use something like git submodule to download the source to a folder in your tree and then do add_subdirectory

* Vendor the google test source code within your repository

* Build google test externally and link it using find_package(GTest) - Not recommended by the google test authors anymore

## Enabling testing

To enable testing you must include the following line in your top level CMakeLists.txt

```
enable_testing()
```

This will enable testing for the current folder and all folders below it.

## Adding a testing executable

Create binary(s) which includes all the unit tests that you want to run.

```
add_executable(ReverseTest ReverseTest.cpp src/Reverse.cpp)

target_link_libraries(ReverseTest
    GTest::GTest 
    GTest::Main
)
target_include_directories(ReverseTest
    PRIVATE
        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/include
)
```
In the above code, a unit test binary is added, which links against the google test 
unit-test-framework using the ALIAS target setup during the [download and build](https://github.com/ttroy50/cmake-examples/blob/master/05-unit-testing/google-test-download/3rd_party/google-test/CMakeLists.txt)
of GTest.

## Add a test

To add a test you call the [add_test()](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/add_test.html) function. This will create a named test which will run the supplied command.

```
# add the test {test name} and class test 
add_test(reverse_class_test ReverseTest)
```

In this example, we create a test called reverse_class_test which will run the executable created by the ReverseTest executable created from the call to add_executable
